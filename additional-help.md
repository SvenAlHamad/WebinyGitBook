# Additional Help

Webiny is about making web development simpler for both professionals and people interested in becoming one. We know first hand that starting in this branch requires tremendous amounts of knowledge and in the beginning you often get stuck, don't know how to move on and then often give up on things being so close to the solution.

We don't want that to happen in our community. That's why we've taken additional effort to create [Webiny Discourse Forum](https://forum.webiny.com/), a place where you can ask questions, provide code samples and information to other members of our community. We are also monitoring posts on a daily basis, so we will try and assist any member in need.
