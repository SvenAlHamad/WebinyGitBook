# Overview

While Webiny CMS itself offers a great amount of options and flexibility for creating dynamic and feature rich content, it also supports any type of custom development. You can create anything ranging from small web sites to full featured web applications.

Consisting of two parts - [Webiny API](../t/#webiny-apis) and [Webiny Client ](../t/#webiny-spa), it will provide you with most of the tools you'll need to build your project from ground up.

## Webiny API

Based on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/), we created a complete set of tools, to make API development easy, secure and fast.

Security module, entities \(automatically connected with GraphQL layer\), service manager and other features and mechanisms are already built-in, so you can immediately start working on your project, and not waste time with various configurations and trying to connect different components together. 

## Webiny Client

Modern web applications consist of many different components and often finding the right ones and then connecting them all together becomes harder than expected. That's why we've created [Webiny Client](../t/develop-a-simple-app/untitled-1/), a complete solution for all your web application development needs. 

Based on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), we provide you with features like router, security, over 70 UI components or module loader, which enables you to immediately start working on the project, and not waste time on configurations and trying out different libraries. 

## Webiny Apps

Finally, combining the Webiny API and Webiny Client, you can also build custom apps that can later be reused in other projects, thus saving you valuable time! It could be a simple Webiny API-only app or a complete app with admin interface, for example a simple API logging tool, e-mail manager or a full featured CRM, it's up to you!

Webiny CMS is also implemented as a Webiny app!

And if you are feeling confident and generous, you can even share your app with other developers by simply publishing it to the _Webiny App Repository!_
