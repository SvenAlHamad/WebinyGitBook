# Basic project structure

{% hint style="info" %}
Before reading, make sure you have [Webiny CLI](../../installation.md#install-webiny-cli) installed on your local machine, and that you have a [project]() set up.
{% endhint %}

Webiny offers both [API](../../t/#webiny-api) and [Client](../../t/#webiny-spa) development tools. 

Once you've created a Webiny project, in your project root, you should have the following structure:

```text
.
├── api
└── client
```

So all relevant files for API and Client development are located in `api` and `client` folders respectively.
