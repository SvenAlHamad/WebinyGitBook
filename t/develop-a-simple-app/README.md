# \_\_Create a Simple App

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to create a simple Webiny app. More precisely - a small books database, which we will cleverly call OpenLibrary. It will be used to store books, it's authors and categories to which they belong to.

Before reading, make sure you have [Webiny CLI](../../installation.md#install-webiny-cli) installed on your local machine, and that you have a [project]() set up.
