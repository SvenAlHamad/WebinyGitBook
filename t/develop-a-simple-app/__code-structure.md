# Project Structure

Once you've created a Webiny project, in your project root, you should have the following structure:

```text
.
├── api
└── client
```

So all relevant files for API and Client development are located in `api` and `client` folders respectively.

Both folders don't have a fixed internal structure, meaning you can organize things on your own. However, there are one or two important files, which we will discuss in the following sections.

Let's start building our app! The first step is to build the underlying GraphQL-powered API, which is the topic covered in the [next](webiny-api/) section.
